            <p>Water is one of the basic necessities for every living being and we cannot imagine a life without water. It is the natural resource and the main constituent of our planet earth. Water is the universal solvent and plays a key role in the existence of various forms of life on the planet earth. It is widely used for various purposes such as washing, bathing, cleaning, cooking, drinking, and other industrial and domestic uses.
                Water is a colourless and odourless substance that is essential for the survival of living beings. There are various sources of water such as wells, rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans, big dams, and streams. As we all know, nearly 70 to 80 percent of the Earth surface is covered by water, among which only 1-2 per cent water is pure and suitable for human use.Farmers can also contribute to this system of conservation of water by using Drip irrigation system in their fields. This is a type of irrigation system which can be practised by all framers to save water. In this system, water is directly supplied to the plant roots and prevents water from being wasted by evaporation.</p>
